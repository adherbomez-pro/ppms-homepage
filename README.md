## Key Features

-   **Customizable Interface**: Easily select and organize sections to be displayed on the homepage.
-   **Light & Dark Mode Support**: Seamlessly switch between themes based on user preferences.
-   **WCAG Compliance**: Adheres to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure a fully accessible experience for all users.
-   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device types, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms.

## Technologies Used

-   **Vue 3**: Framework for building interactive and modern web interfaces.
-   **CSS3 with Custom Properties**: Leveraging CSS variables for theme management and style consistency.
-   **Figma**: Used for UI/UX design and prototyping.
-   **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility audits to ensure high standards across different themes and devices.

## Accessibility & Performance Audits

To ensure a fully accessible and performant application, the project has been audited using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse). The audits were conducted for different scenarios, including light and dark modes on both desktop and mobile devices. These results confirm the applicationâ€™s adherence to WCAG standards.

You can view the detailed Lighthouse reports here:

## Figma Design Access

For a detailed understanding of the visual structure and design principles, you can access the Figma file that was used for this project:

This link showcases the design choices and provides insight into the UI/UX considerations made during development.

## Dataset

The application includes a structured dataset located in `src/config/dataset`. Each section is represented by a title, type, and a list of labels and values.
The data is adapted using a `SectionAdapter` function, which transforms the raw data into a format suitable for rendering within the application. This modular approach allows easy expansion and customization of the dataset, ensuring flexibility for future enhancements.

## My Contributions

During this project, I focused on:

-   Intuitive, usable and simple UX
-   Implementing a flexible and scalable theming system for both light and dark modes.
-   Ensuring the UI adheres to accessibility standards while maintaining a clean design.
-   Conducting performance and accessibility audits using Lighthouse to guarantee high standards.
-   Optimizing the Vue.js components for performance and responsiveness.
